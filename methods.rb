# Defining methods
#  Example 1 : Adding two numbers

    def addition(a,b)
      puts c = a + b
    end

    addition(2,3)


# Example 2 : calculator

    def calculator(a,b)
      puts "The sub of #{a} and #{b} is #{a + b}"
      puts "The difference of #{a} and #{b} is #{a - b}"
      puts "The multiplication of #{a} and #{b} is #{a * b}"
    end

    puts "The result of first calculation"
    calculator(1,2)
    puts "The result of first calculation"
    calculator(30,10)
